# AeroSim Unreal Project

This repo sets up a basic Unreal Engine 5 project to use the [AeroSim Unreal Plugin](https://github.com/aerosim-open/aerosim-unreal-plugin) for connecting Unreal rendering with the simulation platform along with assets from the [AeroSim Unreal Asset Library](https://github.com/aerosim-open/aerosim-assets-unreal) as an additional content plugin.

See the [AeroSim repo](https://github.com/aerosim-open/aerosim) for instructions on how to install and use this as a sim renderer.
